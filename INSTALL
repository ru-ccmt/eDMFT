Copy or link one of the configure.py.* as your configure.py file.

You have the following options:
configure.py.macos  -- for MAC
configure.py.intel  -- for linux based on intel compilers
configure.py.gnu    -- for linux based on gnu   compilers
configure.py.mix_gnu_mkl -- mixure of the last two

You can edit it and set better configuration if you know where your
fft library of gsl library is.

You have to install fft library, gsl library, and python with numpy, scipy, pybind11

Once you have properly set up configure.py, just run setup.py script
