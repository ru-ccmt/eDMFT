0) During installation check for /usr/bin/time executable. If it does not exists, use someting alternative.
0) The new script findRot.py is intelligent enough to find rotation for all atoms in the case.indmfl file. Single execution after dmft1 step should arrange all rotations.
1) Break up the LDA and DMFT loops such that both programs run concurently and simultaneously.
2) The code does support ferromagnetic calculation. Just switch on Ferro in params.dat
4) forces in the presence of SO not yet implemented.

5) In dmft1 we should use Binomial theorem to speed up calculation:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_inverse_theorem
   Also make sure that impurity times are saved in ':log'. They seem to be absent in current version!

6) In dmft2 we should also use Binomial theorem, as well as efficient eigenvalue solvers for "Hermitian+low-rank matrices".


explain the following routines:
x_spaght.py
FS_convert.py
wfs_plot.py
status_extend.py
