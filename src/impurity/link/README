To create cix file for link-DMFT, one carries out the following steps:

1) Produce cix-file for single site DMFT.  To do that, tou need
 "Trans.dat" file, which contains some basic information for single
 site DMFT. If you have similar file, just copy it to your
 directory. If not, you can submit single site DMFT run to obtain cix
 file. You can kill the run as soon as you have cix-file.

2) Prepared case.indmfl and case.indmfi files for two-site DMFT. 

3) Run "dmft1" step, to obtain the impurity levels. They will appear in case.Eimp?

4) From this impurity levels (
Ek=[E_{xz,k=0},E_{xz,k=pi},E_{yz,k=0},E_{yz,k=pi},...] ), you can
recompute local impurity levels, which are
Elocal=[0.5*(E_{xz,k=0}+E_{xz,k=pi}),0.5*(E_{yz,k=0}+E_{yz,k=pi}),...]. If
these levels are similar to levels in single-site DMFT run, you can
use cix file from the above run. If not, you can rerun "atom_d.py" and
input the improved single-site DMFT energies. You can also change
Hund's J in this step.

Here is an example for generating single-site DMFT cix file:
>atom_d.py l=2 J=0.7 cx=0.0 OCA_G=False "CoulombF='Ising'" "Eimp=[0.,-0.04999291,-0.03876849]"

You will get new actqmc.cix

5) Run link.py to compute two-site DMFT cix file:

> link.py -U 6. -E "[0.,1.4378107,0.86557738,0.47224477,0.88272563,0.47754649]"
